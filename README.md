# Team Gaia - CanSat 2024/2025 Competition  

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **Team Gaia**, a small student team from St Joris College Eindhoven participating in the CanSat competition organized by ESA.  

Our goal is to design, build, and deploy a small satellite roughly the size of a soda can. The satellite will collect data while descending from approximately 1km in altitude. This repository contains all the code, documentation, and resources related to our project.

## **Project Overview**  

### 1. **Primary Mission**  
Gaia's primary mission is to measure temperature and pressure data at various altitudes and transmit them in real-time to the ground station once every second.

This data will also be used to calculate the **survivability** of human or similar water- and carbon-based lifeforms in the atmosphere. Our CanSat serves as a proof of concept for an exploration satellite, capable of being deployed in extraterrestrial atmospheres to evaluate their habitability.

### 2. **Secondary Mission**  
To further improve our **survivability** calculation and gather data about our flight performance, we will also measure the following:  
- **CO2 concentration**   
- **Fine particle concentration** 
- **UV light intensity**  
- **Precise vessel position data**
- **Vessel angle and g-force measurements**
